Errors:

- Not all keysyms found. make returns i.e.
	[..]/key-overlay.c:1744: error: ‘XK_logicalor’ undeclared (first use in this function)

	Solution: define all groups in /etc/include/X11/keysym.h I.e. add
	#define XK_TECHNICAL
	#define XK_PUBLISHING
	#define XK_APL
	to the header file.

- Alt key did not work.
- Selection with Shift+Arrow keys not implemented.
- Global shortcuts, like Ctrl+F1 are not captured by metacity.
