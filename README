Errors:

- Not all keysyms found. make returns i.e.
	[..]/key-overlay.c:1744: error: ‘XK_logicalor’ undeclared (first use in this function)

	Solution: define all groups in /etc/include/X11/keysym.def. I.e. add “#define XK_TECHNICAL“.


- Alt-Key did not work.
- Some Symbols are wrong.
- Selection with Shift+Arrow keys not implemented.
- Global Shortcuts, like Ctrl+F1 are not captured by Metacity.
